# Computer Chess Notation

This is meant to be a starter-guide for computer chess notation, but at the moment is
only a pointer to other resources with information on a few different computer chess
notations. However, the following content will be added with time:

* Types of computer chess notations that exist.
* How they are used.
* Benefits and cons of using different notation systems.
* How Zoor implements reading and writing different notations.

## Notation Systems

* **Portable game notation** (PGN) See [here][1] and [here][2].
* **Forsyth-Edwards notation** (FEN) See [here][3] and [here][4].
* **Extended position description** (EPD) See [here][5].
