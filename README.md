My personal chess engine. The seed has been planted.

Still have plenty to code before this is a working chess engine, so I don't recommend
downloading this repo, at least not yet. I'm currently working on the class that
represents the board, which also handles the logic for piece moves.

Todo list:
- finish board class
- implement search logic
- implement evaluation logic
